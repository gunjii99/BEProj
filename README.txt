These are files from my Final Year project in my undergraduate degree.
The project name is Smart Irrigation System, its based on a research article published in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture.
Its an IoT based Irrigation System designed to easily control the irrigation systems using Machine Learning and open source technologies.
This system considers Atmospheric Temperature, Humidity and Soil Moisture to decide whether the soil should be irrigated.
The system uses a Mobile Application to control the water motor remotely.
The accuracy achieved was 86%.
Technologies used: Python, Android, IoT.
